Step 1. git init
telling the git to initialize in specific directory. now git will initialize all its necessary files in the .git directory.

After initializing git, we need to tell git, on what files to be included for the commit
(or what files are needed to track.)


Step 2: git add .
. denotes all files and folders to be added for the commit/tracking.
instead of . you can specify specific file/folder to include it for the commit.

After the files are added, if there are no changes, we can commit the file.

in between any time, you can use git status command to check the status of git.

Step 3: git commit -m "your changes info"

Step 4: Done

Step 5: Nothing to do
